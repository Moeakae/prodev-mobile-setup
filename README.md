# prodev-mobile-setup

## Overview

This setup focuses on preparing the environment for mobile development using the **Expo Framework** for React Native. Expo simplifies mobile app development by allowing us to run and test applications directly on physical devices using the **Expo Go** app.

Unlike traditional mobile development which requires emulators or simulators, Expo Go provides a lightweight and cost-effective way to test apps seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.

- **Node.js LTS** (https://nodejs.org/)
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A compatible **operating system**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
